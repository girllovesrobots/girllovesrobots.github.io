			Activity Starter

		<p>
			</br>In this tutorial, I learned about using Activity Starter in App Inventor. This app is interesting because it shows how applications in Android can seamlessly open other applications on the mobile device. The change that I made to the Activity Starter app includes the addition of a latitude, longitude, and zoom input boxes on the main screen and a reset button. These changes are documented in the bulleted section below.

			I encountered no difficulties with the creation of this application.

			<ul>
				<li><b>Input Boxes:</b> these text boxes allow the user to find a particular location on earth, given only latitude and longitude coordinates. The zoom level exists to give the user the ability to see more details at a local level or to see the neighboring locations. Screenshots of the input screen boxes and the corresponding map appear below</li>

			Colored Dots
		</br><p class="centered-image"><img src="dots_ex.png" width="288" height="512"></p>
		</h1>
		<p>
			</br>This app is a version of paint, but for the Android phone. In this tutorial, I learned about changing screens and how to save and load files to my Android device. This application is interesting because having "drawing" functionality allows the user to create pictures and images. In terms of modifications to this application, I added the option to upload images to the application and added the ability to share image creations. See the bulleted descriptions following these paragraphs for information on how the changes were incorporated into the Colored Dots application.

			I encountered no difficulties with screen change management. However, when I first made modifications to the application, I had issues displaying the app on my Emulator and Andriod device. In the end, I learned that I had been working with a broken .aia file. With that in mind, I learned that despite the much faster design and implementation App Inventor 2 allows, it lacks flexibility.

			<ul>
				<li><b>Background Changer Screen:</b> this screen gives the user the option to add image of their choice to their canvas. Essentially the user has the option of uploading an existing photo from their mobile device file storage or to take a photo using the phone's camera. </li>
				</br><p class="centered-image"><img src="dots_back.png" width="288" height="512"></p>
				<li><b>Sharing Button:</b> this button gives the user the option to share their creation with friends. Essentially the user need only click the "Share" button, and a list of sharing options such as email, text, social media, etc will pop up. </li>

			Stock Quotes
		</br><p class="centered-image"><img src="stocks_ex.png" width="288" height="512"></p>
		</h1>
		<p>
			This app gives the user the ability look up basic information about stocks. Edits to this application include the ability for the user to select different options surrounding a particular company's stock. Additionally, this application gives the user the ability to look up the ticker symbol of a desired company. This application is interesting because it allows the user to obtain multiple pieces of information about a company's stock. This is particularly useful if the user merely needs a few key pieces of information, rather than being bombarded with a large amount of data he/she may not find relevant when checking up on a stock for the day. Additionally, if the user does not know the ticker symbol of the company whose stock he/she wishes to obtain, the user can do a quick look up without opening up a separate web browser. Essentially, this application provides simple, quick, and efficient access to stock data. See the bulleted descriptions following these paragraphs for information on how the changes were incorporated into the Stock Quotes application.

			I had no difficulties when creating this application.

				<li><b>Look Up Ticker Symbol Button:</b> the user need only type in the name of the company of interest and then click the button to pull up an internal webpage that displays ticker symbols relevant to the inputted company name</li>

			Food Explorer
		</br><p class="centered-image"><img src="food_ex.png" width="288" height="512"></p>
		</h1>
		<p>
			This app gives the user the ability look up calorie info for a particular food item. Instead of giving a ballpark estimate for a particular food, it allows the user to select the brand/restaurant that created the food item. This application allows the user to speak or type in the desired food item. To help motivate healthy eating, the change I incorporated into this application was the ability to "add" food items to a food diary and provided alternatives when too much unhealthy food is consumed.
			See the bulleted descriptions following these paragraphs for information on how the changes were incorporated into the Food Explorer application.

			I had difficulty storing multiple pieces of data using the TinyDB. When creating the food diary, I encountered multiple issues trying to store multiple "entries" to my Food Diary. It was difficult to devise a way to maintain the database of multiple food objects. As a result, I decided to instead focus on a single food item.

			<ul>
				<li><b>Adding Food:</b> the user is given the ability to add food he/she has eaten to a new screen, where he/she can see the food eaten and the calorie content</li>
				</br><p class="centered-image"><img src="food_choice.png" width="288" height="512"></p>
				<li><b>Food Diary:</b> the user is given the ability to check the calories of the food item he/she has eaten and find an lower calorie alternative. In the event the user has consumed an item that is greater than 700 calories, the application will automatically suggest a healthier alternative, complete with a few pieces of nutritional information!</li>
